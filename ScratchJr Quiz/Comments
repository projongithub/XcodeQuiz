A suggestion in terms of priorities:

FIXES

1 - Fix the constraints for different screen sizes;
2 - Fix hiding the keyboard for the home screen;
3 - Try to remove all the Force Unwraps from various parts of the app;

IMPROVEMENTS

4 - Try to make the questions engine reusable to avoid having multiple view controllers that are very similar;
5 - Try to animate the transitions between questions and screens.
